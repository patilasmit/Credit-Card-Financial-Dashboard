DAX Queries:
here we are making a age_group of customer age using queries for practice.
1. AgeGroup = SWITCH(
TRUE(),
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
"unknown"
)

we are making a income group of customer using queries for practice.
2. IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
TRUE(),
'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] <70000, "Med",
'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High",
"unknown"
)

here we are just making an additional colunm to sort week_numbers.
3. week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date])

creating an revenue column using some valuse.
4. Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]

current week revenue measure
5.Current_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
FILTER(
ALL('public cc_detail'),
'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])))

previous week revenue measure
6.Previous_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
FILTER(
ALL('public cc_detail'),
'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])-1))

Week on week revenue 
7. Wow = Divide ((([Current_week_Revenue] - [Previous_week_Revenue] , [Previous_week_Revenue])))
